      <p>BlueEconomy is here to provide information and resources on the opportunities and benefits of a resource-based economy. We believe that by focusing on how we can use resources effectively, we can achieve both environmental sustainability and economic prosperity</p>
      <p>Our mission is to inspire a shift in the way we view and use resources, towards a more sustainable and equitable future. Our vision is a blue economy â€” one where our economy is aligned with the natural world and social need. From this perspective, our work highlights the concurrent crisis of overconsumption, resource depletion and social inequality.</p>
